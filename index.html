                        <p class="description"> Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011)
                         was an American businessman, inventor, and investor 
                         best known for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc.
                          Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and
                           majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal
                            computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early
                             business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>

                <h3>the following list is the timeline of steve's life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1961</strong> - The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as Silicon Valley.</li>
                    <li><strong>1968</strong> - Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the company that summer.</li>
                    <li><strong>1970</strong> - Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006 autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.</li>
                    <li><strong>1972</strong> - Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in Portland, Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested him, such as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.</li>
                    <li><strong>1974</strong> - Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to California to live in a commune.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1976</strong> - Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.</li>
                    <li><strong>1977</strong> - Apple incorporates.</li>
                    <li><strong>1977</strong> - Releases the Apple II, the first commercially available personal computer in a plastic case with color graphics--and Apple's first successful personal computer.</li>
                    <li><strong>1980</strong> - Apple goes public, putting Jobs' net worth north of $200 million.</li>
                    <li><strong>1984</strong> - Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl commercial airs, introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting. "For the first time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer you can't lift." Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small computer with a graphical user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>1985</strong> - CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple chairman, saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with my life. It's obvious that I've got to do something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server of the World Wide Web.</li>
                    <li><strong>1986</strong> - For $10 million, buys the Graphics Group division of Lucasfilm that becomes Pixar Animation Studios.</li>
                    <li><strong>1988</strong> - NeXT Computer releases its first computer.</li>
                    <li><strong>1993</strong> - NeXT discontinues hardware business, gets into software instead. The company is renamed NeXT Software, Inc.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - Becomes Pixar's president and CEO. Later in the year, Jobs brings Pixar public, one week after the release of "Toy Story," with Tom Hanks doing the voice of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. The film earns $192 million at the box office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for celebrities to lend their voices to animated characters.</li>
                    <li><strong>1996</strong> - Returns to Apple, as an adviser, after it buys NeXT for $429 million.</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong> - Becomes CEO, initially as the de facto chief, then as interim chief in September.</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong> - Announces a $150 million investment from Microsoft, coupled with a partnership on Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for the Mac.</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong> - Introduces the Apple Store, which lets consumers custom-order Apple products directly from the company online.</li>
                    <li><strong>1998</strong> - Apple returns to profitability.</li>
                    <li><strong>2000</strong> - Drops the "interim" from his CEO title at the Macworld Expo, joking that he would be using the title "iCEO," paying homage to the company's product-naming conventions. Takes a $1 annual salary. Soon terminates projects including Newton and OpenDoc, and changes licensing terms to make Mac-cloning cost-prohibitive. Technologies developed at NeXT ultimately evolve into Apple products such as the Mac OS.</li>
